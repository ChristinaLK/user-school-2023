## Meal Reimbursement Tips

Again, if you are **not** part of the UW&ndash;Madison community,
we can reimburse you for dinners Sunday through Wednesday,
all meals on Thursday,
and breakfast on Friday. We have curated a page of some possible [dining options](./dining.md) to use as inspiration.

Some tips for successful reimbursements:

*   Keep receipts for your meals – if anything so that you remember how much meals cost!

*   We can reimburse up to $20 for breakfast, $21 for lunch and $35 for dinner, including tax and tip.
    For dumb reasons, we can reimburse only $32 for Sunday dinner.

*   If it is not on the receipt, be sure to write the tip amount yourself, so you do not forget.

*   We cannot pay for any alcohol, although non-alcoholic drinks are OK&nbsp;&mdash;
    ideally, pay for alcohol separately.

We will explain the reimbursement process in detail after the School, but the tips above will help.
