## General Information About the School Schedule

### Travel Schedule

Most participants should plan to travel as follows:

-   **Arrive on Sunday, August 6, 2023,** prior to 6:30 p.m. (if possible).
    There is a welcome social gathering on Sunday evening for all participants (including instructors),
    and then classes begin on Monday morning.
    This is a nice way to get to know each other and to start the week.

-   **Depart on Saturday, August 12, 2023,** any time.
    The School ends with a closing dinner on Friday evening,
    so it is best to stay that night.

If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the six nights of this schedule.

### School Hours

The School is generally Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to about 5:00 p.m.,
and there will be optional work sessions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings.

[The tentative schedule](../schedule.md) is available now and will not change much before the event.

## Accessing the OSPool After the School

See the [project creation instructions](projects.md) to continue using the OSPool 
after the school.
